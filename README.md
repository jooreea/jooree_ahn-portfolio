# jooree_ahn-portfolio

## Description of Work
An employer wants to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples to assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position. This repository includes the source code for Jooree Ahn's portfolio webpage that links to samples of their deployed applications.

## Actions Taken on Requirements
1. The webpage presents the developer's name, a recent photo of them, and links to sections of the webpage that are about about them, their work, and how to contact them.
2. When clicked on, the links in the navigation bar scroll to their corresponding sections.
3. The image of first application presented in the work section is larger in size than the other images in that section.
4. When the work section images are clicked on, then tabs to corresponding deployed applications are opened.
5. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices, a responsive layout adapts to the viewport.
